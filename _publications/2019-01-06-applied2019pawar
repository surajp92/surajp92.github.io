The propeller of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) operates at low Reynolds number in laminar to turbulent transition region. The performance of these propellers can be calculated accurately using RANSE solver with γ − Reθ transition model. In this study, the global and local hydrodynamic characteristics of open and ducted propeller are investigated using the γ − Reθ transition model. The capability of the γ − Reθ transition model to capture laminar to turbulent transition on the surface of the open propeller is demonstrated by comparison with published experimental results. The application of transition model for the propeller Ka-4-70 inside the duct 19A shows that the centrifugal forces are dominant at low Reynolds number and the flow is mainly directed in the radial direction. The transition model is able to predict complex flow physics such as leading-edge separation, tip leakage vortex, and the separation bubble on outer surface of the duct. The accurate prediction of these flow phenomenon can lead to correct calculation of global hydrodynamic forces and moments acting on the propeller at low Reynolds number.
