In this study, we present a non-intrusive reduced order modeling (ROM) framework for large-scale quasi-stationary systems. The framework proposed herein exploits the time series prediction capability of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network such that: (i) in the training phase, the LSTM model is trained on the modal coefficients extracted from the high-resolution data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) transform, and (ii) in the testing phase, the trained model predicts the modal coefficients for the total time recursively based on the initial time history.
