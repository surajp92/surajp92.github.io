Education
======
* B.Tech. in Mechanical Engineering, Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai, 2014
* M.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University, 2018
* Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering, Oklahoma State University, 2022 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Spring 2019 - Present: Graduate Research Assistant, CFD Lab, Oklahoma State University 
  * Developed [ANN and CNN frameworks](https://github.com/surajp92/2D_Turbulence) for a-priori investigation of data-driven subgrid-   scale models for LES
  * Developed  [NIROM framework](https://github.com/surajp92/DNN-based-NIROM) using DNN and LSTM algorithms for model order reduction of fluid flows.
  * Assessed the performance of different [iterative solvers](https://github.com/surajp92/Research_Codes/tree/master/Compact\%20Schemes) (Gauss-Seidel, Conjugate gradient, BiCGStab methods) and multigrid framework using higher-order compact scheme

* Spring 2017 - Fall 2018: Graduate Research Assistant, Autonomous Systems and Controls Lab, Virginia Tech
  * Developed a CFD RANSE (transition) model to validate the open-water performance of ducted propeller
  * Designed and optimized post-swirl propulsor for AUV using surrogate-based optimization algorithm.
  * Conducted field trials with the designed propulsor and measured optimal efficiency with 10\% variance.
  * Lead mechanical design engineer for Dragon AUV towing a large payload having 80% more drag than the AUV.
  * Developed a CFD URANS model with DFBI and overset dynamic mesh to calculate hydrodynamic derivatives.

* Fall 2013 - Spring 2014: Undergraduate Project Assistant, Hindalco Industries, Mumbai
  * Developed a [2D transient thermal model](https://github.com/surajp92/Undergraduate-Project) for heat transfer annealing cycle with an objective to achieve desired properties with minimum energy consumption.
  * Designed an experimental setup to determine variation of thermal contact conductance of aluminium coil.
